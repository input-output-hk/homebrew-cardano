# Homebrew tap for IOHK Cardano Projects

**WARNING** OSX may choose to break homebrew at any time. We **STRONGLY** recommend using the nix overlay if you have nix installed at https://github.com/input-output-hk/iohk-nix

Also a more automated approach to run jormungandr using `nix` can be found at https://github.com/input-output-hk/jormungandr-nix

To use with homebrew (not recommend):

brew tap input-output-hk/cardano

brew install jormungandr
